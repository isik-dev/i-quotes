import React from "react";

// i could make both function based component and class based component however i chose to make a class based component
// also we should notice that by convention component names are CamelCase:

class PostDefinitions extends React.Component {
  render() {
    return <div>Post Definitions from here</div>;
  }
}

export default PostDefinitions;
